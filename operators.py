####### Boolean expressions
print(5 == 5)
print(5 == 6)
print(type(True))
print(type(False))

####### comparison operators
x = 8
y = 10
print(x != y)           # x is not equal to y
print(x > y)           # x is greater than y
print(x < y)           # x is less than y
print(x >= y)           # x is greater than or equal to y
print(x <= y)           # x is less than or equal to y
print(x is y)           # x is the same as y
print(x is not y)           # x is not the same as y

####### Logical operators
n = 9
print(x > 0 and x < 10)
print(n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0)
print(not (x > y))
print(17 and True)
